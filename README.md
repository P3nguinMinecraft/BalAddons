# Installation
#### This module requires ChatTriggers. Get it here: **[ChatTriggers Mod](https://www.chattriggers.com/)**

1. Ensure that you have the latest stable release of ChatTriggers for Forge 1.8.9
2. Launch Minecraft Forge 1.8.9
3. Go ingame and run `/ct import PenguinAddons`
4. ChatTriggers should automatically reload. If not, run `/ct load` or restart your game.


##### Alternate Method (the GitHub is more up to date, because CT takes a long time to approve releases)

2. Go to your .minecraft folder
