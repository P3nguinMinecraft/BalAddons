# About
#### ChatTriggers QOL Module for Hypixel Skyblock. This is aimed towards Bal Farming, but also has some nice features that I find helpful in other areas. 
[ChatTriggers Link](https://www.chattriggers.com/modules/v/PenguinAddons)

# Installation
#### This module requires ChatTriggers. Get it here: **[ChatTriggers Mod](https://www.chattriggers.com/)**

#### NOTE THAT THE MODULE IS OUTDATED ON ChatTriggers Website, so use Alternate Method

##### Main Method
1. Ensure that you have the latest stable release of ChatTriggers for Forge 1.8.9
2. Launch Minecraft Forge 1.8.9
3. Go ingame and run `/ct import BalAddons`
4. ChatTriggers should automatically reload. If not, run `/ct load` or restart your game.


##### Alternate Method (the GitHub is more up to date, because CT takes a long time to approve releases)
1. Make sure that you have ChatTriggers installed and you have launched the game at least once
2. Go to your .minecraft folder
3. Navigate to config > ChatTriggers > modules
4. Download (clone) this GitHub and unzip it
5. Put the folder named "BalAddons" into the modules folder
6. If the game is currently open, run `/ct load` or restart the game.
